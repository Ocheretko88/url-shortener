# Simple URL Shortener

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- Clone this repository via GitHub Desktop or copy this command: `git clone git@github.com:Ocheretko88/url-shortener.git`.
- Go to the folder application using `cd url-shortener` command.
- Run `composer install`.
- Run `npm install`.
- Copy `.env.example` file to `.env` on the root folder. For example, you can use `cp .env.example .env` command.
- Open your `.env` file and change the database name `DB_DATABASE`, username `DB_USERNAME` and password `DB_PASSWORD`.
- Run `php artisan key:generate`.
- Run php `artisan migrate`.
- Run `php artisan serve` or `./vendor/bin/sail/ up` if you're using Docker.
- Go to `localhost` and enjoy.


Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
